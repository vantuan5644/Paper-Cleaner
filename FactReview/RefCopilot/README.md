# RefCopilot

A focused reference-accuracy checker for academic papers. Given a PDF, URL,
BibTeX file, or plain text bibliography, RefCopilot extracts each citation and
verifies it against arXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenReview, Crossref, and
(optionally) OpenAlex, emitting:

- **Errors** for fabricated / hallucinated references that don't match any
  retrievable record.
- **Errors** for retracted citations (publisher retractions surfaced via
  OpenAlex's `is_retracted` flag, plus arXiv author-withdrawn preprints).
- **Warnings** for outdated references (an arXiv preprint that's since been
  published, an older arXiv version, workshop → full upgrades).
- **Warnings** for incomplete references (missing DOI / arXiv ID / venue / year,
  truncated authors, abbreviated venue names).

For each warning where a verified record is available, RefCopilot also emits
a **corrected BibTeX entry** with a leading provenance comment listing which
backend supplied each field (and its lookup URL) so reviewers can copy-paste
a fix into their `.bib` file.

Suspected hallucinations are rechecked by an LLM pass that downgrades
recognisable non-academic citations (system cards, vendor blog posts, technical
reports, dataset cards, standards, white papers) to a warning instead of a
hard error.

## Install

From the FactReview workspace root:

```bash
pip install -e "./RefCopilot[dev]"
```

RefCopilot reuses FactReview's LLM client (`src/llm/client.py`). LLM
extraction is **always on** — there is no regex fallback — so the
`openai-codex` provider must be configured before running. By default the LLM
client is loaded from `<repo>/src/`; set `REFCOPILOT_FACTREVIEW_SRC` to point
at a different FactReview checkout if needed.

## CLI

```bash
refcopilot check <input>
```

`<input>` may be:
- a `.bib` file
- a `.pdf` file
- an arXiv URL or paper URL (auto-downloaded)
- plain bibliography text

Useful flags: `--output-dir DIR`, `--no-llm-verify`, `--no-cache`,
`--cache-dir DIR`, `--cache-ttl-days N`, `--max-refs N`, `--debug`.
Run `refcopilot check --help` for the full list.

Cache management:

```bash
refcopilot cache prune --ttl-days 30
```

## Library

```python
from refcopilot import RefCopilotPipeline

pipeline = RefCopilotPipeline()
report = pipeline.run("path/to/paper.pdf")
print(report.summary)
```

## FactReview integration

The `refcopilot.factreview` module is what FactReview's refcheck stage calls.
It exposes:

```python
from refcopilot.factreview import check_references, format_factreview_markdown
```

`check_references()` returns the dict written to `reference_check.json`.
Each warning row's ``corrected_bibtex`` field carries the suggested
replacement entry. `format_factreview_markdown()` renders the embedded
Markdown summary that appears in the final review report — errors only by
default, since the embedded summary is meant to flag fabrications. Pass
`include_warnings=True` (used by FactReview's adapter) to surface warnings
with their inline corrected-BibTeX block, or `include_unverified=True` to
also list unmatched references.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` | Optional Semantic Scholar API key (recommended to avoid rate limits). |
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_BASE_URL` | Override the S2 base URL. |
| `OPENALEX_API_KEY` | Optional OpenAlex API key. When set, OpenAlex is queried in parallel with arXiv / S2 / OpenReview / Crossref as an extra cross-check signal; when empty, OpenAlex is skipped. Free key at https://openalex.org/settings/api. |
| `OPENALEX_BASE_URL` | Override the OpenAlex base URL (default `https://api.openalex.org`). |
| `CROSSREF_MAILTO` | Optional contact email. Crossref needs no API key (it's always queried), but supplying a `mailto` routes requests to Crossref's faster, more reliable "polite pool". |
| `CROSSREF_BASE_URL` | Override the Crossref base URL (default `https://api.crossref.org`). |
| `REFCOPILOT_FACTREVIEW_SRC` | Override the FactReview `src/` path used to load the LLM client. |

## Running the tests

```bash
pytest
```

The `pytest` configuration deselects `slow` tests by default. Run
`pytest -m slow` to include them.
